    "As we saw, Python's core library doesn't have that many functions. In order to use functions that people have written before, but are not included in core Python, we need to load a library. In Python, this is done via the `import` command.\n",

    "We will be doing what is typically called a geocoding API (Application Programming Interface) request. This is where you put in an address (or some other sort of query keywords) and get the spatial coordinates. You do this on a daily basis when you type an address in Google Maps and find the latitude and longitude of that place. As we will learn more about API requests in the future, we do not require that you do this programmatically, but you are welcome to do that if you like challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this manually but still using geocoding APIs (with OpenStreetMap), examine this url:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/?q=campanile+berkeley&format=geojson\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the part before \"?\". The question mark (\"?\") marks the start of the arguments that you are passing into the API. We are passed two arguments -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `q` (for query) is campanile berkeley (OSM is usually smart enough to parse fuzzy addresses like this one), we use \"+\" instead of a space because space creates problems in urls.\n",
    "2. `format` is `geojson`, which is a format commonly used to store geocoded geometries. (Use this format for your other queries, too.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert an equal sign \"=\" between a parameter and an argument (the value that you want to assign to a parameter), and insert ampersands \"&\" between arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see the following as part of the returned text when you click on the link above. As you can imagine, you can extract the coordinates (the last two numbers) programmatically fairly easily (and you will have to do that if you have thousands of coordinates), but for now let's do it by hand.\n",
